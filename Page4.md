# This page is about Rome, Italy
## I studied abroad here summer 2018

I was able to study abroad with CIEE summer of my sophomore year.  
I went with two of my best friends from high school.  
One goes to the University of Arkansas and one goes to Texas Christian.  
We were there for a month and it was an amazing experience.

[This is the program I went through.](https://www.ciee.org/)

**Below is a picture I took while in Rome of the Trevi fountain.**

_I was able to go to more places in Italy while I was there, such as:_

* Venice
* Florence
* Tivoli
* Amalfi Coast
